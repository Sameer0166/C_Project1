    It initializes an integer variable 'j' to 1, prints its value using the pre
    decrement operator, and then prints the value of 'j' again after the decrement.
    The pre-decrement operator (--j) decreases the value of 'j' by 1
    before its current value is used in the expression.
    This is a simple demonstration of how to use the pre-decrement operator in C.
    The program is useful for understanding how the pre-decrement operator works,
